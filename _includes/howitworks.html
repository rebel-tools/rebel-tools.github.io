                    <p>Jibber was born because working with JSON data in Xcode is incredibly frustrating. We set out to build a tool that would integrate seamlessly into all your projects and show you the information you need when you need it. </p>
                    <p>We use Bonjour to connect without any configuration to your devices and the iPhone Simulator, and Jibber works with any networking library or framework using NSURLSession or NSURLConnection APIs.</p>
                    <p><strong>Update:</strong> Jibber now also lets you debug <em>push notification</em> payloads!</p>
