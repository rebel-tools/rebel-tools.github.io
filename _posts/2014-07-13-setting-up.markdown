Setting up Jibber is a breeze! The first step is to drag and drop the framework into your Xcode project. Then, head on over to your `Project Settings`, and under the `General` tab, scroll down to `Linked Frameworks and Libraries`, and add `libz.dylib`. Finally, add `-ObjC` to your `Other Linker Flags`, that can be found under `Build Settings`. You can skip this step if you're using Cocoapods, as this would have already been set. 

And that's it! Your project is all set up to use Jibber!
